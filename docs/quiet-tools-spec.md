# Tool activity: summary line instead of the stream, details one click away

Upstream discussion: anneschuth/claude-threads#505 (shape proposed in the
2026-09-02 comment; `hidden` was agreed by the maintainer on 2026-08-25).

## What it does

Today every tool Claude uses renders into the reply post as it happens
(`Bash …`, `Read …`, then `↳ ✓ (5s)`), and there is no switch. For a coding
session that is the point; for an assistant-style channel the answer is
buried under the commands that produced it.

Two per-platform settings, beside `sessionHeader` / `stickyMessage` /
`lifecycle`:

```yaml
platforms:
  - id: assistant
    type: slack
    toolActivity: summary     # full (default) | summary | hidden
    toolDetails: thread       # thread (default with summary) | none
```

`toolDetails: file`, with `toolDetailsDir` / `toolDetailsUrl`, arrives in
PR 2 (see **Delivery**); this PR rejects those three at startup.

| `toolActivity` | The reply post |
|---|---|
| `full` | unchanged: every tool inline with its `↳` indicator |
| `summary` | one **live line at the top of the turn's post**, `🔧 12 tools · 40 s · Bash`, updated as tools start and finish; the name is the tool most recently started, so the line says what the bot is doing and not only how much it has done (@thejdubb02 in #505); `· 1 ❌` appended when a tool failed; with `toolDetails: file` and a URL (PR 2), the line links to the details page. Claude's text follows as today |
| `hidden` | nothing about tools at all, and no `↳` orphans. What the maintainer agreed to in #505 |

| `toolDetails` | Where the full rendering goes when `toolActivity` is not `full` |
|---|---|
| `thread` | posted as replies **in a thread under the turn's post**, streamed the same way the reply is (edit-in-place, split on length). In a thread-mode session the turn's post is already a thread reply and Slack has no nested threads, so the details land in the same thread after the reply; that is `full` with the tools moved below the answer, and documented as such |
| `file` (PR 2) | appended to `<toolDetailsDir>/<platformId>/<sessionId>/<turn>.html`, one file per turn, plus `index.html` per session listing turns. Serving the directory is the operator's job. With `toolDetailsUrl` the summary line links to `<url>/<platformId>/<sessionId>/<turn>.html` |
| `none` | the summary only |

Default: `full` / `none`, so an existing config behaves exactly as before.
`summary` without `toolDetails` means `thread`. Config errors, thrown with
the field path at startup like the other per-platform fields: `toolDetails`
with `full`; `hidden` with `thread` (hidden has no post of its own to hang
a thread on; use `summary`, or — from PR 2 — `file`); `toolDetailsDir` /
`toolDetailsUrl` with anything but `file`.

Untouched in every mode: permission prompts, plan approvals, questions, task
lists, `send_file`, the bug button, session errors. Those are not tool
rendering; they are interactive or they are failures. A *tool* that fails is
Claude's business and shows only as the `❌` count.

## Why

- Assistant use (#505): replies only, but the receipt stays one click away.
- Anything that consumes the reply post as an answer — text-to-speech, a
  digest, a downstream bot — has to skip forty tool lines to find it.
  `summary` is what makes the post the answer.
- `file` (PR 2) over a web server outside the daemon: the daemon writes, the
  operator's existing server serves, nothing new listens. ⚠️ Tool details
  contain command lines and outputs. The directory must be served **behind
  auth**; the spec says so, the README says so, and the default is no URL.

Considered and dropped: a git commit per tool call (a `Read` has no diff;
forty commits a turn would wreck the repo the agent works in) and a
`!tools` runtime toggle (round 2 if anyone asks; the config is enough to
start).

## How

### Transformer (`src/operations/transformer.ts`)

Tool rendering already produces ops tagged `isToolOutput` (tool_use display,
`server_tool_use`, and the `↳` result indicator). With `toolActivity !== 'full'`
the transformer emits, instead of those ops, a `tool_activity` op:

```ts
{ type: 'tool_activity', kind: 'start', toolUseId, name, display }      // display: the same rendered line
{ type: 'tool_activity', kind: 'end',   toolUseId, ok, elapsedMs, display } // display: the ↳ line
```

Nothing else in the transformer changes; special tools keep their own ops.
A `TransformContext.toolActivity` field carries the mode (default `full`).

### Executors

- **`ToolActivityExecutor`** (new, `src/operations/executors/tool-activity.ts`)
  owns the per-turn counter
  `{ started, finished, failed, firstStartAt, lastEndAt, lastTool }`
  and renders the summary line. On each op it asks the content executor to
  re-render the post header (debounced through the existing 500 ms flush).
  The transformer emits an explicit `{ kind: 'turn_end' }` op from the
  `result` event (inferring it from a flush reason would couple the executor
  to flush internals); the last render is the final line, the sink's
  `turnEnded()` runs, and the counter resets.
- **Content executor**: every write to a post goes through one
  `renderPost(postId, body)` path (today `flush`, `handleSplit` and the
  task-list repurpose branch each write directly; Codex plan review), which
  prepends the header when `postId` is the turn's first post. A header
  update with nothing pending still renders: it edits the first post, or
  creates it header-only when the turn has no post yet. Length and height
  decisions for the first post use `header + body`. Gains an optional
  `header` (one line) that belongs to the **first post of the turn only**. The executor remembers
  `turnFirstPostId` and that post's body; a header update re-renders that
  post as `header + body` even after streaming has moved on to a
  continuation post. Continuation posts never carry the header, so a split
  cannot bake a stale receipt into one post and a fresh one into the next
  (Gemini plan review). The header is not part of `pendingContent`, so
  splitting and length checks are unchanged apart from counting its length
  on the first post.
- **Details sinks** (`src/operations/tool-details/`), one interface:
  `ToolDetailsSink { append(op): void; turnEnded(): Promise<void>; linkFor(turn): string | null }`.
  - `thread`: a second `ContentExecutor` **without** the task-list bump
    callbacks (they would let a details post repurpose the task-list post)
    and with its own `createPost` that registers posts as `tool_details`
    and does **not** touch `updateLastMessage` (a details post must never
    become the session's "latest reply"). Its context posts with
    `rootId = turnFirstPostId` of the main executor in direct-channel mode
    (the reply is a channel post, the details thread hangs under it), and
    `rootId = the session's threadId` in thread mode (Slack has no nested
    threads; `thread_ts` of a reply is rejected with `invalid_thread_ts`), so
    there the details interleave as peers after the reply. It streams the
    `display` strings exactly like the reply and starts lazily on the first
    tool of a turn; if the main post does not exist yet, the first header
    render creates it.
  - `file`: appends escaped `<pre>` blocks to the turn file (ANSI escape
    sequences stripped first; tool output is full of them) and rewrites
    `index.html`; deterministic path so the link exists from the first tool.
    Writes are sequential per session. A write error is **reported once in
    the channel as a system error and the sink stops for the session**; the
    reply itself keeps streaming. Not silent, not fatal to the answer.
  - `none`: no-op.

### Config (`src/config/types.ts`)

`PlatformInstanceConfig.toolActivity?`, `toolDetails?`, `toolDetailsDir?`,
`toolDetailsUrl?`; resolved next to the overhead fields into
`PlatformOverhead.tools: { activity, details, dir, url }` with the same
`resolve…` validation and the same wiring through `src/index.ts` →
`SessionManager` → `TransformContext` / executor options as `lifecycle`.

### Turn boundaries

A turn's counter and its details sink describe **one CLI process**. Every
respawn — `!cd`, a worktree switch, `!permissions interactive` — kills that
process mid-turn, so both must start over. `MessageManager.clearTurnState()`
does exactly that and `restartClaudeSession` calls it unconditionally:
`clearClaudeSessionState()` is not enough, because a resume restart
deliberately skips it to keep its task numbering.

### Delivery

Two PRs so each stands alone:

1. `pr/quiet-tools`: `full | summary | hidden`, `thread | none`, transformer
   op, executors, config, tests. (#505's tool half.)
2. `pr/quiet-tools-file` stacked on it: the `file` sink and `toolDetailsUrl`.

## Tests (first)

- transformer: each mode × (tool_use, server_tool_use, tool_result ok/error,
  special tool) → which ops come out; in both quiet modes no
  `append_content` op carries tool text, and the start time is consumed by
  the end op (so `elapsedMs` exists and no `↳` line can orphan).
- ToolActivityExecutor: counter and line text through start/end/error/turn
  end; the line with and without a link.
- content executor: header stays on the first post of the turn across a split;
  the continuation post has none; a header update after the split edits the
  first post, not the current one; a final header set after a split still
  reaches the header post when the closing text lands on the continuation.
- respawn: `restartClaudeSession` clears the turn in progress whether or not
  it resumes, and the next turn's counter starts at one.
- content executor: header rendered above content, survives a split, counted
  in length checks.
- thread sink: posts under the main post's id, lazy start, thread-mode
  degrade.
- file sink: path, escaping, index rewrite, write error propagates.
- config: defaults, `summary` implies `thread`, `toolDetails` with `full`
  rejected with the config path in the message.

## Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| Two fields, not one enum | what to show and where to keep the rest are independent; `summary+file` and `hidden+file` are both real |
| Summary line at the top of the post, not the bottom | it is the receipt for the whole turn and must not move as text streams in |
| Details as a second content executor | the streaming, splitting and rate behaviour already exist there; a new poster would reimplement them badly |
| `file` writes HTML, not markdown | the point is a browser; markdown in a browser is raw text |
| Keep an explicit `turn_end` op rather than finalising from the existing `StatusUpdateOp` (Codex suggested the latter) | `turn_end` is emitted *before* the final flush, so the final summary line lands in the same edit as the last text; the status op comes after the flush and would cost one more edit of the first post per turn |
| The header post is the post being written when the turn's first tool starts, not retroactively the turn's very first post (Codex code review asked for the latter) | if a long preamble was already split into two posts before the first tool, the receipt sits on the post where the work began and the details thread hangs there too; it never moves after adoption, which is what the reader needs. Chasing the earlier post would mean editing a post the executor has already left behind, for no gain |
| No HTTP server in the daemon | one more listener, auth, TLS; the operator already has a web server |
| Flat fields, not a nested `tools:` block (Gemini suggested nesting) | the sibling dials `sessionHeader` / `stickyMessage` / `lifecycle` are flat and `toolActivity` is the name agreed in #505; PR 1 adds two fields, the dir/url pair only comes with PR 2 |
| Resolved settings ride on the same per-platform record as the other dials (Gemini wanted a separate type) | one map, one wiring path, already threaded through `SessionManager`; a second type for two fields is plumbing for its own sake |

## Open

(none)

## Decided during review

- Q-001: does the summary line also name the last tool (`· Bash`)? **Yes.**
  @thejdubb02 asked for it in #505 and the maintainer agreed in #534: once
  the stream is hidden this line is the only liveness signal, so it has to
  say what the bot is doing. MCP names are shortened to the tool part —
  `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` renders as `browser_navigate`.

## Lessons learned

- CodeRabbit's CLI dropped its WebSocket twice on the PR 1 diff (2026-09-02); the
  `--light` run is what finished. Codex and Gemini reviewed the full diff.
- **A reset nobody calls is not a reset.** `ToolActivityExecutor.reset()`
  existed from the first commit and had a test, but its only caller,
  `MessageManager.reset()`, has no production caller — the respawn paths use
  `clearClaudeSessionState()`. Tested and wired are different properties.
- **A one-line header on a post that a split has already left behind needs
  its own render pass.** Every write clears `headerDirty` only when it wrote
  the header post; a flush that writes the continuation post leaves the
  header running forever. Checking the flag after the flush covers every
  path, which comparing post ids at each call site would not.
- **Half the turn state lived somewhere else.** Resetting the tool counter
  left `turnOpen` / `headerPostId` set on the content executor, which clear
  only on a `result` flush — and a respawn never produces one. The next
  turn's summary then edited the abandoned reply and its details threaded
  under it: the *same* bug, one layer down. `abandonHeaderTurn()` releases
  the other half.
- **"Injective" is a claim, and ASCII tests do not check it.** `safeSegment`
  used variable-width hex with no delimiter, so `' AC'` and `'€'` both
  produced `_20AC`. The first fix — encode per UTF-8 byte — traded one
  collision for a quieter one: `TextEncoder` maps *every* unpaired surrogate
  to the same replacement bytes, so `'\uD800'` and `'\uDC00'` would have
  collided on `_EF_BF_BD`. Fixed width per code unit (`_XXXX`) is what the
  claim actually needs. Two reviewers found the second collision
  independently; neither found it from the tests, which is the point — the
  tests were still ASCII.
- **A per-session sink is not per-session state.** Every resume built a fresh
  file sink for the same session id, and it started at turn 1 — overwriting
  the first page and rebuilding the index from only the turns it had written,
  which unlinked all the earlier ones. The turn counter now continues from
  what is on disk and the index is listed from disk.
- **The DM-discovery call site has now dropped per-platform settings three
  times** (memory/routines/watches, #529's, and this PR's details dir + URL).
  The derived config spreads its parent, so the fields are always *there*; it
  is the reader that lists a subset. `resolvePlatformTools(config, path)`
  takes the whole `PlatformInstanceConfig`, so there is no argument list to
  under-fill and a stripped object literal fails to compile. An all-optional
  parameter shape would have documented the intent without enforcing it — it
  accepts `{}` — which is what I shipped first.
- **A retry needs to know what was attempted, not what was confirmed.**
  `headerBody` advanced only on a successful update, so a lost response left
  it stale — and the new header re-render then overwrote the post with the
  older body, deleting text the platform had already accepted. Since an
  update replaces the whole post, recording the attempted body is right
  whether or not it arrived.
