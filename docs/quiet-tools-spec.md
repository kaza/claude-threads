# Tool activity: summary line instead of the stream, details one click away

Upstream discussion: anneschuth/claude-threads#505 (shape proposed in the
2026-09-02 comment; `hidden` was agreed by the maintainer on 2026-08-25).

## What it does

Today every tool Claude uses renders into the reply post as it happens
(`Bash …`, `Read …`, then `↳ ✓ (5s)`), and there is no switch. For a coding
session that is the point; for an assistant-style channel the answer is
buried under the commands that produced it.

Two per-platform settings, beside `sessionHeader` / `stickyMessage` /
`lifecycle`:

```yaml
platforms:
  - id: slack-vvs
    type: slack
    toolActivity: summary     # full (default) | summary | hidden
    toolDetails: file         # thread (default with summary) | file | none
    toolDetailsDir: /home/herder/.claude-threads/tool-details   # file only; this is the default
    toolDetailsUrl: https://agents.vvs-capital.com/tool-details  # file only; no default → no link
```

| `toolActivity` | The reply post |
|---|---|
| `full` | unchanged: every tool inline with its `↳` indicator |
| `summary` | one **live line at the top of the turn's post**, `🔧 12 tools · 40 s`, updated as tools start and finish; `· 1 ❌` appended when a tool failed; with `toolDetails: file` and a URL, the line links to the details page. Claude's text follows as today |
| `hidden` | nothing about tools at all, and no `↳` orphans. What the maintainer agreed to in #505 |

| `toolDetails` | Where the full rendering goes when `toolActivity` is not `full` |
|---|---|
| `thread` | posted as replies **in a thread under the turn's post**, streamed the same way the reply is (edit-in-place, split on length). In a thread-mode session the turn's post is already a thread reply and Slack has no nested threads, so the details land in the same thread after the reply; that is `full` with the tools moved below the answer, and documented as such |
| `file` | appended to `<toolDetailsDir>/<platformId>/<sessionId>/<turn>.html`, one file per turn, plus `index.html` per session listing turns. Serving the directory is the operator's job. With `toolDetailsUrl` the summary line links to `<url>/<platformId>/<sessionId>/<turn>.html` |
| `none` | the summary only |

Default: `full` / `none`, so an existing config behaves exactly as before.
`summary` without `toolDetails` means `thread`. Config errors, thrown with
the field path at startup like the other per-platform fields: `toolDetails`
with `full`; `hidden` with `thread` (hidden has no post of its own to hang
a thread on; use `summary`, or `file`); `toolDetailsDir` / `toolDetailsUrl`
with anything but `file`.

Untouched in every mode: permission prompts, plan approvals, questions, task
lists, `send_file`, the bug button, session errors. Those are not tool
rendering; they are interactive or they are failures. A *tool* that fails is
Claude's business and shows only as the `❌` count.

## Why

- Assistant use (#505): replies only, but the receipt stays one click away.
- Our voice desk reads the reply post aloud once it settles; forty tool lines
  in it are forty lines it must not read. `summary` is what makes the post
  the answer.
- `file` over a web server in the daemon: the daemon writes, Caddy (or
  anything) serves, nothing new listens. ⚠️ Tool details contain command
  lines and outputs. The directory must be served **behind auth**; the spec
  says so, the README says so, and the default is no URL.

Considered and dropped: a git commit per tool call (a `Read` has no diff;
forty commits a turn would wreck the repo the agent works in) and a
`!tools` runtime toggle (round 2 if anyone asks; the config is enough to
start).

## How

### Transformer (`src/operations/transformer.ts`)

Tool rendering already produces ops tagged `isToolOutput` (tool_use display,
`server_tool_use`, and the `↳` result indicator). With `toolActivity !== 'full'`
the transformer emits, instead of those ops, a `tool_activity` op:

```ts
{ type: 'tool_activity', kind: 'start', toolUseId, name, display }      // display: the same rendered line
{ type: 'tool_activity', kind: 'end',   toolUseId, ok, elapsedMs, display } // display: the ↳ line
```

Nothing else in the transformer changes; special tools keep their own ops.
A `TransformContext.toolActivity` field carries the mode (default `full`).

### Executors

- **`ToolActivityExecutor`** (new, `src/operations/executors/tool-activity.ts`)
  owns the per-turn counter `{ started, finished, failed, firstStartAt, lastEndAt }`
  and renders the summary line. On each op it asks the content executor to
  re-render the post header (debounced through the existing 500 ms flush).
  The transformer emits an explicit `{ kind: 'turn_end' }` op from the
  `result` event (inferring it from a flush reason would couple the executor
  to flush internals); the last render is the final line, the sink's
  `turnEnded()` runs, and the counter resets.
- **Content executor**: every write to a post goes through one
  `renderPost(postId, body)` path (today `flush`, `handleSplit` and the
  task-list repurpose branch each write directly; Codex plan review), which
  prepends the header when `postId` is the turn's first post. A header
  update with nothing pending still renders: it edits the first post, or
  creates it header-only when the turn has no post yet. Length and height
  decisions for the first post use `header + body`. Gains an optional
  `header` (one line) that belongs to the **first post of the turn only**. The executor remembers
  `turnFirstPostId` and that post's body; a header update re-renders that
  post as `header + body` even after streaming has moved on to a
  continuation post. Continuation posts never carry the header, so a split
  cannot bake a stale receipt into one post and a fresh one into the next
  (Gemini plan review). The header is not part of `pendingContent`, so
  splitting and length checks are unchanged apart from counting its length
  on the first post.
- **Details sinks** (`src/operations/tool-details/`), one interface:
  `ToolDetailsSink { append(op): void; turnEnded(): Promise<void>; linkFor(turn): string | null }`.
  - `thread`: a second `ContentExecutor` **without** the task-list bump
    callbacks (they would let a details post repurpose the task-list post)
    and with its own `createPost` that registers posts as `tool_details`
    and does **not** touch `updateLastMessage` (a details post must never
    become the session's "latest reply"). Its context posts with
    `rootId = turnFirstPostId` of the main executor in direct-channel mode
    (the reply is a channel post, the details thread hangs under it), and
    `rootId = the session's threadId` in thread mode (Slack has no nested
    threads; `thread_ts` of a reply is rejected with `invalid_thread_ts`), so
    there the details interleave as peers after the reply. It streams the
    `display` strings exactly like the reply and starts lazily on the first
    tool of a turn; if the main post does not exist yet, the first header
    render creates it.
  - `file`: appends escaped `<pre>` blocks to the turn file (ANSI escape
    sequences stripped first; tool output is full of them) and rewrites
    `index.html`; deterministic path so the link exists from the first tool.
    Writes are sequential per session. A write error is **reported once in
    the channel as a system error and the sink stops for the session**; the
    reply itself keeps streaming. Not silent, not fatal to the answer.
  - `none`: no-op.

### Config (`src/config/types.ts`)

`PlatformInstanceConfig.toolActivity?`, `toolDetails?`, `toolDetailsDir?`,
`toolDetailsUrl?`; resolved next to the overhead fields into
`PlatformOverhead.tools: { activity, details, dir, url }` with the same
`resolve…` validation and the same wiring through `src/index.ts` →
`SessionManager` → `TransformContext` / executor options as `lifecycle`
(see `pr/quiet-lifecycle` commit 364c371 for the pattern).

### Delivery

Two PRs so each stands alone:

1. `pr/quiet-tools`: `full | summary | hidden`, `thread | none`, transformer
   op, executors, config, tests. (#505's tool half.)
2. `pr/quiet-tools-file` stacked on it: the `file` sink and `toolDetailsUrl`.

VVS runs `summary` + `file` behind Caddy with auth on
`agents.vvs-capital.com/tool-details/`.

## Tests (first)

- transformer: each mode × (tool_use, server_tool_use, tool_result ok/error,
  special tool) → which ops come out; in both quiet modes no
  `append_content` op carries tool text, and the start time is consumed by
  the end op (so `elapsedMs` exists and no `↳` line can orphan).
- ToolActivityExecutor: counter and line text through start/end/error/turn
  end; the line with and without a link.
- content executor: header stays on the first post of the turn across a split;
  the continuation post has none; a header update after the split edits the
  first post, not the current one.
- content executor: header rendered above content, survives a split, counted
  in length checks.
- thread sink: posts under the main post's id, lazy start, thread-mode
  degrade.
- file sink: path, escaping, index rewrite, write error propagates.
- config: defaults, `summary` implies `thread`, `toolDetails` with `full`
  rejected with the config path in the message.

## Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| Two fields, not one enum | what to show and where to keep the rest are independent; `summary+file` and `hidden+file` are both real |
| Summary line at the top of the post, not the bottom | it is the receipt for the whole turn and must not move as text streams in |
| Details as a second content executor | the streaming, splitting and rate behaviour already exist there; a new poster would reimplement them badly |
| `file` writes HTML, not markdown | the point is a browser; markdown in a browser is raw text |
| Keep an explicit `turn_end` op rather than finalising from the existing `StatusUpdateOp` (Codex suggested the latter) | `turn_end` is emitted *before* the final flush, so the final summary line lands in the same edit as the last text; the status op comes after the flush and would cost one more edit of the first post per turn |
| The header post is the post being written when the turn's first tool starts, not retroactively the turn's very first post (Codex code review asked for the latter) | if a long preamble was already split into two posts before the first tool, the receipt sits on the post where the work began and the details thread hangs there too; it never moves after adoption, which is what the reader needs. Chasing the earlier post would mean editing a post the executor has already left behind, for no gain |
| No HTTP server in the daemon | one more listener, auth, TLS; the operator already has a web server |
| Flat fields, not a nested `tools:` block (Gemini suggested nesting) | the sibling dials `sessionHeader` / `stickyMessage` / `lifecycle` are flat and `toolActivity` is the name agreed in #505; PR 1 adds two fields, the dir/url pair only comes with PR 2 |
| Resolved settings ride on the same per-platform record as the other dials (Gemini wanted a separate type) | one map, one wiring path, already threaded through `SessionManager`; a second type for two fields is plumbing for its own sake |

## Open

- Q-001: does the summary line also name the last tool (`· Bash`)? Asked in
  #505. Default: count and time only.

## Lessons learned

- CodeRabbit's CLI dropped its WebSocket twice on the PR 1 diff (2026-09-02); the
  `--light` run is what finished. Codex and Gemini reviewed the full diff.
