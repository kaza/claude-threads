**Run Claude Code from your team's chat.** The bot lives on your machine, next to your checkout and your local tools. Sessions stream live into Slack or Mattermost threads where teammates watch and steer what Claude does. No cloud sandbox and no enterprise plan required: it works with the Claude subscription or API key you already have.

> _Think of it as screen-sharing for AI pair programming, but everyone can type._

</table>

## How it works

1. Mention the bot in a channel: `@claude fix the flaky test in ci.yml`
2. It spawns a real Claude Code session in a working directory on your machine.
3. Everything streams into the thread: output, diffs, task lists, permission prompts.
4. Steer by replying in the thread or reacting with emoji. Anyone you invite can do the same.

## Features

- **Live streaming** - Responses, tool calls, diffs, and a sticky task list render in the thread as the session runs
- **Slack and Mattermost** - Connect multiple workspaces at once. Mattermost support means this also works where chat is self-hosted and cloud assistants cannot go
- **A session per thread** - Concurrent sessions, each with its own working directory, resumed automatically after a bot restart
- **Your machine, your setup** - Sessions use your local checkout plus whatever MCP servers and plugins you already configured
- **Your existing subscription** - Any Claude Pro/Max account or API key works. An optional multi-account pool routes each new session to the account with the most subscription headroom and cools down rate-limited ones ([docs](https://github.com/anneschuth/claude-threads/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#claude-accounts-optional-multi-account-mode))
- **Permission control by emoji** - `default` prompts the thread for every tool use (👍/✅/👎), `auto` lets Claude's classifier approve low-risk actions, `bypass` skips prompts entirely. Switch per session with `!permissions`
- **Collaboration** - `!invite` teammates into a session; commits Claude makes get `Co-Authored-By:` trailers for everyone involved
- **A real chat citizen** - Nine MCP tools let Claude post files, follow permalinks, react, and DM, each behind its own guardrail (see [What Claude can do in your chat](#what-claude-can-do-in-your-chat))
- **Git worktrees** - `!worktree feature/foo` isolates Claude's changes on a branch
- **Memory** - Channels learn over time: `!remember` saves shared team notes every session sees, sessions distill durable facts when they end, and Claude's native auto-memory keeps per-repo project knowledge — all scoped per channel ([docs](https://github.com/anneschuth/claude-threads/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#memory-memory-default-fully-enabled))
- **Routines** - `!routine every weekday at 9am, summarize open threads` schedules recurring work; runs post as new threads in the channel, confirmed before saving and managed with `!routines` ([docs](https://github.com/anneschuth/claude-threads/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#routines-routines-default-enabled))
- **Watches** - `!watch when someone reports an incident, triage it` reacts to matching channel messages: a free keyword prefilter plus a semantic check fire a session right in the triggering thread ([docs](https://github.com/anneschuth/claude-threads/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#watches-watches-default-enabled))
- **Files both ways** - Drop any file into the chat for Claude to read, with full multimodal for images and PDFs; Claude posts screenshots, plots, or PDFs back with `send_file` (100 MB cap)
- **Voice notes** - With `transcription:` configured (ElevenLabs Scribe), an audio clip is transcribed before Claude sees it and the transcript is echoed into the thread; with `speech:` the agent answers in audio on request or always per channel; see [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#transcription-transcription) and [Voice replies](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#voice-replies-speech)
- **Quiet mode and verbosity dials** - `!mentions on` makes a session respond only when mentioned; session headers and the channel sticky each have `full`/`minimal`/`hidden` modes
- **Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows** - Windows via Git Bash or WSL
- **Auto-update** - The bot watches npm for new versions; `!update now` applies one from chat

## What Claude can do in your chat

Each session runs its own MCP server, giving Claude tools that act on the chat platform. Every tool carries its own guardrail; nothing reaches beyond the channels the bot can already see.

| Tool                   | What Claude does with it                              | Guardrail                                                     |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `send_file`            | Post a file from the working directory into the thread | Path validated against the session working directory          |
| `read_post`            | Resolve a Slack or Mattermost permalink to its content | Bot's channel plus public channels only                       |
| `list_thread`          | Read the current thread, or a permalinked one          | Same channel scoping                                          |
| `read_channel_history` | Read recent messages from a channel                    | Bot's channel plus public channels, capped at 100 messages    |
| `search_messages`      | Search messages                                        | Mattermost only, capped at 25 results                         |
| `react_to_post`        | Add an emoji reaction                                  | Defaults to the message that triggered it                     |
| `update_own_post`      | Edit one of its earlier posts                          | Bot-authored posts only                                       |
| `send_dm`              | Send a direct message to a channel member              | 3 per recipient per session; the thread approves each one     |
| `permission_prompt`    | Ask the thread to approve a tool use                   | This one _is_ the approval flow (👍/✅/👎)                    |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (pick one)
bun install -g claude-threads   # with Bun (recommended)
npm install -g claude-threads   # with npm

# Run the setup wizard
cd /your/project
claude-threads
```

The interactive wizard configures your Slack or Mattermost bot, tests the credentials, and gets you running in minutes. For creating the bot account itself, follow the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/anneschuth/claude-threads/blob/main/SETUP_GUIDE.md).

**Prerequisites**

- **Bun 1.2.21+** or **Node 20+** - [Install Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Claude Code CLI** - test with `claude --version` (needs a subscription or API key)

Then mention the bot in your channel:

```
@claude help me fix the bug in src/auth.ts
```

Unknown `!commands` are checked against Claude Code's own slash commands and passed through when they match.

## Interactive Controls

**Permission approval** - When Claude wants to run a tool:

- 👍 Allow this action
- ✅ Allow all future actions
- 👎 Deny

**Plan approval** - When Claude presents a plan: 👍 approve, 👎 request changes

**Questions** - React with 1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣ 4️⃣ to answer multiple choice

**Session control** - ⏸️ interrupt, ❌ or 🛑 stop, 🔄 resume a timed-out session

**Housekeeping** - 🔽 collapses long task lists and subagent output; 🐛 on an error post opens a bug report

## Collaboration

```
!invite @colleague    # Let them participate
!kick @colleague      # Remove access
```

Messages from users outside the session can be approved one at a time by the session owner with a 👍 reaction.

Invited collaborators end up as `Co-Authored-By:` trailers on commits Claude makes during the session. Each collaborator runs `!github-email <their-noreply-address>` once (find yours at <https://github.com/settings/emails>) and the bot remembers it across sessions.

## Git Worktrees

Keep your main branch clean while Claude works on features:

```
@claude on branch feature/add-auth implement user authentication
```

Or mid-session: `!worktree feature/add-auth`

## Access Control

Restrict who can use the bot during setup, or reconfigure later with `claude-threads --setup`. An empty allowlist lets anyone in the channel start sessions, so leave it empty only in channels you trust.

Who may do what (start sessions, react to permission prompts, approve guest messages) is written down in the [authorization model](https://github.com/anneschuth/claude-threads/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## How it compares

Driving a coding agent from chat is a busy space: Anthropic, OpenAI, Cursor, and Cognition each ship their own integration, and other open-source projects exist too — several of them excellent. The main difference is where the session actually runs.

The cloud products share a working style: you delegate from a thread, the work runs in a vendor-hosted sandbox, and progress updates and a pull request come back — Claude Tag additionally stays in the conversation as a shared teammate the whole channel can talk to. If your repositories live on GitHub and you want nothing to host, they are a good choice; Anthropic's own integration in particular runs the same Claude Code this bot does.

claude-threads makes the opposite choice: the whole session stays in the thread and on your hardware. Output streams live, permission prompts land as emoji reactions, invited teammates type into the same session, and Claude works against a local checkout with whatever MCP servers and plugins you already configured. That fit matters when chat is self-hosted Mattermost, when code cannot leave the building, or when you want a session in chat to behave exactly like the one at your desk. The trade-off: you run the bot yourself, on a machine that has the repository.

A few more things set it apart. The full Claude Code permission model lives in the thread: every tool use can prompt for 👍/✅/👎 approval, with three modes switchable mid-session. Sessions are multiplayer: `!invite` teammates while Claude works, messages from uninvited users are gated behind approval, and commits credit everyone involved as co-author. An optional [account pool](https://github.com/anneschuth/claude-threads/blob/main/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#claude-accounts-optional-multi-account-mode) routes each new session to the Claude subscription with the most headroom and cools down rate-limited ones. And nothing assumes GitHub — the session works against any local checkout, whatever its host.

This table is current as of August 2026. All of these products move quickly — if it has gone stale, [open an issue](https://github.com/anneschuth/claude-threads/issues).
