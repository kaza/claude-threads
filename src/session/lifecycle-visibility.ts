/**
 * Which lifecycle posts a platform wants to see.

 * `sessionHeader` and `stickyMessage` already let an operator turn down the
 * session table and the pinned status. Neither touches the lifecycle posts —
 * the idle warning, the timeout notice, the pause notice — which in
 * channel-as-task use are the bulk of what a quiet channel contains. This adds
 * the third knob, with the same `full` / `minimal` / `hidden` shape.

/**
 * Whether a lifecycle post should be made.
 *
 * - `full` — everything, exactly as today.
 * - `minimal` — drops the idle warning. It predicts something that has not
 *   happened and usually never does: the timeout is resumable, so the next
 *   message brings the session straight back. The other notices report a state
 *   change that already occurred.
 * - `hidden` — no status posts.
 *
 * ⚠️ `abnormal-exit` survives every level, `hidden` included. It fires only on
 * a non-zero exit code, so it is a failure report rather than overhead.
 * Silencing it would make a session that died indistinguishable from one that
 * finished, which is the one case where quiet is worse than noisy.
